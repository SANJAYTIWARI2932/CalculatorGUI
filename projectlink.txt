Excited to share my latest project: a hosts and travelers website implementing both frontend and backend functionalities.   

Frontend Technologies: Utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for building a responsive and user-friendly interface.

Backend Technologies:  Node.js, Express, to create a robust server, manage databases, and handle user authentication.

Database Management: Designed and implemented a database schema using MongoDB to efficiently store and retrieve user and property information.
